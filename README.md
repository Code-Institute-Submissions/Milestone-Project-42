# Totally Mad-Libz

This website will serve the purpose of providing a platform and game for creating Mad Libs stories - these being stories generated by users providing a number of words as inputs, which will
then be rendered into a story template with the inputs placed in random places in the story. This should aim to induce feelings of fun and humour for users. Mad lib stories generated will be saved
in the library, where it can be compared with others in terms of upvoting entries that users find most entertaining. Users would also have the option to edit and delete the entries they created should they desire to.
By having such an application available, it could provide fun for dinner parties and social gatherings, both physical and virtual. Inspiration for this idea
has mainly come from the recent need for people needing new ways to entertain themselves indoors during the covid-19 situation. 

### Developer's goals:
* To display his skills in creating a game-like application for his portfolio that is feasible to create within a limited amount of time
* To spread joy to any degree within society during a difficult time for everyone
* To build an exciting application for the developer's portfolio, this being an idea he'll want to develop further in the future

### Goals of users:
* To have a new game and application that can entertain and humour them
* To have an easy-to-use tool for users to include another fun activity for party/social gathering situations, both physical and virtual

## UX

### Ideal User

#### Users visiting my website would be:
* From anyone in the world
* English speaking
* Enjoy social games

#### Users on my website will want to:
* Get inspiration for an activity to include at a social event/party
* Run the game effectively in a fun way
* Have an easy-to-understand user experience

#### Why this website is a great solution:
* Currently the majority of online mad lib generators can be confusing and/or have an outdated design for the modern era of web design, a factor in itself that can disenchant people seeking this kind of application.
* As mentioned above, at the tme of developing this project, we are dealing with the difficult situation of covid-19, requiring/strongly recommending people to stay indoors. With this has come the struggle for people to socially interact and have fun in new ways - predominately virtually
* This solution can provide an entertaining activity for individuals and/or groups, especailly in these times where adding this to virtual social interactions can provde extra entertainment and humour to share with others

### User Stories
1. As a new visitor to the website, I want it to be very clear as to what the purpose of the website is
2. As a new user to the mad lib concept, I want information about this presented early and clearly during the experience
3. As a new user to the website, I want to be able to get started quickly in creating my own mad lib
4. As a new user to the website, I want to be able to navigate myself easily to different parts of the website
5. As a new user to the website, I want to be able to easily see previously generated mad lib entries
6. As a new user/returning to the website, I want to be able to get in touch with the site owner to suggest new themes for the mad lib generator
7. As a new/returning user to the website, I want to be able to not only read my mad lib entries, but to also be able to edit and delete these if I so please
8. As a new/returning user, I want to be the only one who can edit and delete my mad lib entries through appropriate user authentication

## Design Choices
My design choices were motivated by wanting to create a website that felt both fun but at the same time give it the look and feel that it would be for adults. I wanted the website to be easy to use and navigate across as well as create positive/humorous experiences for users. The choices I made included the following:

### Themes and snippets

- To help build my HTML and CSS styling efficiently with a professional look, I used the Start Bootstrap theme of One Page Wonder. I chose this theme to kick off my website and it’s landing page (pre-logged in stage) due to the simple and fun response it gives. Since the website aims for simplicity too, I deemed it appropriate to find a theme that would suit a one page style that I could look to repeat across all my HTML pages. The theme also provides attractive positioning of images, something I felt was important in order to grab the user’s attention in a positive manner. The fonts included here of Lato and Catamaran provide impactful but fun text to help engage users further (especially Catamaran for engaging headers).

- For my login, register and insert-words pages I used a Start Bootstrap snippet as inspiration to build simple built elegant forms, these being customized further with button styles and formatting from the One Page Wonder theme

- For the footer I’ve placed in the base.html file I used a footer from a previous project of mine (my Code Institute Milestone Project 1), customizing the content and styling slightly in order to give relevance to it in relation to the website. This footer was used for inspiration purely due to simplicity, which is part of the website’s aims.

### Colours
As a starting point, and perhaps subjective opinion of the developer, the project would get inspiration from two sources:
- The use of an orange colour, which can be associated with energy/fun, which could be used as a starting point for building the colour palette. Through using Coolors, I generated the colour scheme visualised below that I would take inspiration from for the different colours I would use:

* [Coolors colour palette](https://ibb.co/2hW0BzS)

- Making sure I had a hero/background image that would match both the website’s theme of humour as well as the colour scheme decided upon. I opted in the end for this image I found in [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/laugh-neon-light-signage-turned-on-1115680/)

## Features

### Existing Features

#### 1. Consistent Features throughout

- Navbar

- Navbar that was conditional based on if the user was logged in or not. If a user was not logged in, the following options were available
	1. Log In
	2. Sign Up
	3. Website logo, which would always redirect users to the landing page (or welcome page if logged in)

- When users were logged in, they can navigate through the following options:
    1. Home
    2. Create Mad Lib
    3. View all Mad Libz
    4. Logout

- Python logic is in place to check when a user is logged in or not, in which case it displays the navbar options dynamically based on if a user is logged in or not.

- For smaller screens, the navbar turns into a burger icon dropdown icon, where clicking on it will present the options.

- The navbar is sticky and sticks to the top of the page when users scroll. This is to ensure that they always have convenient navigation available at all times. Since the navbar is also slightly transparent and blends with the background, it doesn’t disturb the view of the user when they are going through page content

- Footer
	- A simple footer can be found in all pages, with the website logo text, a disclaimer as to who produced the website, a contact email address, and social media links via clickable icons

- User feedback
	- Python logic, along with flask (flash messages), has been implemented to give users a simple text message feedback on the screen when certain scenarios happen. These include:
		- Trying to register with a username that already exists, in which case users are redirected to the register page with the message ‘User already exists’
		-When a user successfully signs up with a unique username, they are redirected to the Log In page with the message ‘New user successfully created’
		- Logging in with a username and/or password that is incorrect, whereby the user is redirected back to the login page with the message ‘Incorrect credentials’
		- When a user has successfully logged in, the home page display a text below the header with the message ‘You were successfully logged in’
		- Trying to access an edit or delete function of a given user’s mad lib (record) when the user trying to access it isn’t the creator of it, users are redirected back to the home page with the text message ‘Sorry, invalid user’
		- When a user has updated/deleted a record of theirs (that they created), the user is redirected to the library page with the message appearing under the header ‘Mad Lib updated’ or ‘Mad Lib deleted’

- Security
	- A login system is in place, where it stores a user ID, the username, and the user’s password. The password is hashed using the passlib package to ensure high security on passwords stored
	- As part of the login system, user sessions are used to allow/not allow users to carry out certain actions/access certain pages. These include being able to access certain navigation bar items or being able to access update and delete functions of a record the user did not create
	- The repository for this project utilizes the .gitignore file to hide an extensive amount of variables that, if exposed, could compromise user and database data. I used the .gitignore file from this example Github repository to ensure as high security as possible on my repository, alongside additional files that needed to be hidden in relation to the database

- Hero Image/Background
	- I made sure to choose, as part of my Design Choices, a hero/background image that suits the website’s goals and also can go with the decided-on colour palette. I made sure this image was visible throughout to give the consistency and dominant style of the website overall

- Colourful Pink/Orange buttons
	-These buttons are present throughout the majority of pages to help direct users to relevant website locations. The colours used for these are specifically chosen to make them easily identifiable for users to intuitively understand that these provide users with actions

##### Differentiation(s) from Wireframes
- Login system was not considered during the planning phase, but was rather a feature implemented due to the developer judging that there was time for this. This differs from the Woreframes then in terms of:
	- User Feedback
	- Security features
	- Navbar Menu Items

- Contact page/link was removed from the navbar menu, and instead the developer opted for a Footer that would contain contact information (email, social media links)

#### 2. Landing page (not logged in)

- User is presented with initially a logo text and slogan to instantly grab the user’s attention. This is followed by a ‘See More’ button which scrolls the user down to the information section
- The information formats images and text items to alternative sides as the user scrolls down, with content describing what Mad Libs (the game) is, how the website works, and how to get started
- Two buttons at the bottom of the page for signing up or for logging in are presented

* [Landing page (not logged in) 1](https://ibb.co/xXnzLdv)
* [Landing page (not logged in) 1](https://ibb.co/NrzPDqF)
* [Landing page (not logged in) 1](https://ibb.co/FYqjCsy)

##### Differentiation(s) from Wireframes
- The developer had not considered a login system before, so the Log In and Sign Up buttons are additional
- During the development, it was advised that one should have some content that describes what Mad Libs are, so the developer used this landing page as an opportunity to do that with the information section that is accessed either by scrolling down or by clicking the ‘Learn More’ button

#### 4. Sign Up/Log In pages
- These two pages follow an almost identical style to keep a consistent style for authentication forms. The form is a simple card with two input fields and a button to submit the form
- The Sign Up form asks for users to create a user with a username and password. Once done successfully, the user is redirected to the Log In page and form
- The Log In page form asks users for their username and password (which they have signed up with), and if done correctly they are redirected to Home page. If unsuccessful, they are redirected back to the Log In page
- All inputs on these pages are required fields, preventing new/current users from submitting the form with empty fields

* [Register 1](https://ibb.co/dDKwnXc)
* [Register 2](https://ibb.co/G3DdcZ2)
* [Register 3](https://ibb.co/BKQTn55)
* [Login 1](https://ibb.co/DYp67wk)
* [Login 2](https://ibb.co/cbsqBKK)

##### Differentiation(s) from Wireframes
- A login system was not considered during the phase of building the wireframes but rather was developed as an extra feature where the developer found time for it

#### 5. Home page (logged in)
- This page presents two circle images above their respective buttons, where users can choose to either ‘Create a Mad Lib’ or ‘View All Mad Libz’. Content is centered to make it easier to grab the user’s attention. These options stack on top of each other in smaller screens sizes

* [Logged in and on Home page](https://ibb.co/5LshhR4)

##### Differentiation(s) from Wireframes
- Home page for logged in users was not considered due to the login system not being considered earlier in the planning phase.

#### 6. Create Mad Lib
- User is presented with a circular image with a select dropdown menu, where users can pick their ‘Mad Lib Theme’ i.e. the template that will be used that their chosen words will be zipped in to. The selection can be confirmed with the ‘Next button’
- A complementary text is provided below the header to guide users who want to test out the functionality can best do so with the ‘Love Poem’ theme (this being the shortest/easiest one to fill out)

* [Choose Theme 1](https://ibb.co/dpfNtvw)
* [Choose Theme 2](https://ibb.co/gzwwzP1)

##### Differentiation(s) from Wireframes
- The developer opted for a select with dropdown options instead of a carousel. Reasons for this included time constraints on the project, as well as the fact that, with more and more themes potentially built into the database/website, the more difficult/time consuming it would be for users to conveniently navigate through the different options effectively

#### 7. Insert Words/Edit Words
- User is provided a simple card form with text inputs to fill input. The placeholders within each text input provide a prompt for what type of word/s) they should type in for the input. Below these text inputs is the button to ‘Generate Mad Lib’
- In the case of the Edit page (which is accessed via the edit button on a given Mad Lib the user has created), the format and styling is identical, only that the input fields are prefilled with the latest inputs typed in

* [Input Words 1](https://ibb.co/qxsCv1X)
* [Input Words 2](https://ibb.co/yy7FHFH)
* [Edit Words 1](https://ibb.co/tJg4KHb)
* [Edit Words 2](https://ibb.co/82fkkSv)

##### Differentiation(s) from Wireframes
- No major deviations from the wireframe for this page

#### 8. Results
- This page displays the generated Mad Lib, where the user inputs are placed within the template/theme chosen to create a story/text. This is presented in a card with the username of the user who created it, the title of the Mad Lib, and the text
- The user has 3 buttons that they can use, ‘Create Another’, ‘Delete’ and ‘See All Mad Libz’. The ‘Create Another’ button directs users back the the create page where they can choose a theme, the ‘Delete’ button deletes the entry from the library and users are redirected the the library ‘View All Mad Libz’ page, while the ‘View All Mad Libz’ button redirects users to the library page

[Results](https://ibb.co/CK350T8)

##### Differentiation(s) from Wireframes
- The developer included the Delete button here in case the user wished to immediately delete the recently created record. This might be the case if the user is dissatisfied with the generated Mad Lib

#### 9. View All Mad Libz (Library) page
- In a similar style to the results page, every Mad Lib record is displayed in a card, where two in each row is presented on larger screens, while on mobile this witches to one per row
- The top of the page has a clear header, where any user feedback messages (based on user actions) are displayed below this
- Each card also contains two buttons, ‘Edit’ and ‘Delete’, which appear and function only for users who have created the Mad Lib in question

[Library](https://ibb.co/60rZTGP)
[Delete Function](https://ibb.co/9pSRqPd)

##### Differentiation(s) from Wireframes
- Did not include statistics/graphs dashboard on words used. This was due to time constraints and was deemed not a required feature for a ready-to-use application at this stage. This can be, in the future, achieved by using the ChartJS API to visualize data should the developer which to implement this at a later point in time

### Features Left to Implement

#### 1. Private Group Sessions
Group session feature, where a user could create a private session with other users/friends that would only display the Mad Libs this group creates within their session. This would require setting up another collection in the database with user types (needing a group admin and regular users), a group ID (so that non-group users cannot access the group they are not associated with/invited to), and additional code to create a new decorator or elaborate on the current one in place. This would be a complex feature to implement, and with the project time scope in mind, was not realistic to implement at this point

#### 2. CRUD Operations for Mad Lib Templates
Users being able to create, read, update and delete their own Mad Lib templates. This would require creating the relevant functions for this as well as finding the right form structure and process to be able to obtain user template data in the correct format for the database. The developer deemed this a feature that could be included should there be time leftover after implementing the log in system and front-end. However, this proved to not be the case and therefore can be seen as a possible feature to implement after the time scope for Code Institute

#### 3. Javascript/jQuery website beautification
Beautified user feedback using Javascript/jQuery could have improved the user experience in terms of adding greater clarity and smoother transitions in regards to the different CRUD operations performed. Since this isn’t a requirement of the project, the developer deemed this as something that could be improved after the Code Institute time scope in order to focus more time on security and error handling features

#### 4. Statistics/Graph Dashboard
Statistics/graphs dashboard for visualizing popular words and Mad Lib templates used overall, aggregating all the data and presenting it to users as interesting/fun facts. Due to the short time scope of this project, this was deemed as a feature that would be nice to have but not essential for a well-functioning application. This could be easily achieved using the ChartJS API in order to visualize the data in a dashboard

#### 5. Email Authentication
As an extra security feature, have email authentication as an extra step to validate the user. This is a thought for a future development that has been considered at a late stage in developing the project and therefore unrealistic to implement in terms of time and complexity

#### 6. Search function in library page
Since the Mad Lib entries may potentially build up over time, it would be useful for users to be able to search for Mad Libs based on:
- Mad Lib Title (template)
- Username
- Mad Libs that user has created themselves

As with the email authentication feature, this idea was considered in the later stages of development of this project and therefore will be considered for future development outside of the Code Institute’s time scope

#### 7. Admin account
An admin account may be useful in order to have better control of the site’s contents, giving full access rights to delete records if deemed necessary (in the case of, say, malicious/indecent/spam records were being created). While this security feature for bad input isn’t the full proof solution, it could provide the site owner some greater control of website content without having to manipulate records in the database

#### 8. Error page handling
It is generally good practice to set up a function and page for errors such as Page Error 404 in order to give a friendlier user feedback and direction back to somewhere in the website that is accessible. Due to the short time scope of the project, the developer was unable to implement this feature before the submission of this project to the Code Institute but will strongly consider implementing this in future development

### Database Choice
For this project a requirement is that we use the non-relational database MongoDB. While using a relational database such as MySQL would’ve been beneficial to use since my data collections connect with one another, the same end result is achievable by creating logic that submits id values from one collection into another in order to create data relations necessary for the application.

### Data Storage Types
The types of data used for this project, that was stored in the MongoDB database, included:
- ObjectID
- Array
- String

### Collections Data Structure
The Mad Libz website made use of 3 database collections, these being:
- mad_libz_input (User input)
- mad_libz-templates (Mad Lib templates)
- user_info (User Information)

These are described in the visual below. With each collection entity, the first column indicates the field name, second column indicates expected type of data inside, and the third column indicates the official data type.

* [Data Schema by Lucid Charts](https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/e78b678b-4e07-4a05-ad5e-94c21b488174/image.png)

Here are some examples of how the data looks inside the database:
* [Data schema example for user_info collection](/data-schemas/user_info.json)
* [Data schema example for mad_libz_input collection](/data-schemas/mad_libz_input.json)
* [Data schema example for mad_libz_templates collection](/data-schemas/mad_libz_templates.json)

The templates collection stays static, and its ID is passed into a user input document once a user has created a mad lib. This template ID being passed in helps to build the form users are redirected to in order to get the relevant text input fields and prompts so that the resulting mad lib is given the most relevant information/words as possible. When a new user signs up/registers to the website with their username and password, a new document storing this data, along with a generated user ID, is inserted into the user info collection. This user ID is also passed into a user input document when the user creates a new mad lib (record). This helps to restrict other users from editing and deleting that mad lib record which they did not create.

## Technologies Used

### Tools and Libraries
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com) - used as part of being able to initialize Bootstrap components
* [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) - The developer used this tool as their IDE when building this project
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Utilized to simply html structure of website and responsiveness of it. [Popper](https://popper.js.org/) also used to be able to enable some Bootstrap functionality
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - This project used GitHub to be able to store the project remotely
* [Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03) - used for version control of the project
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icons in the footer section for social media links coming from this resource
* [MongoDB.Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) - Used this non-relational cloud database to store the data used for this website
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used Catamaran and Lato fonts for text content
* [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Provides connection between python and MongoDB
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) - to be able to construct and render templates into html using python
* [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) - helps to smoothly present database data and any other variables created in the backend to the frontend
* [Imgbb](https://imgbb.com) - Used to host my images that I would link to to my README file. Experienced issues previously with Github failing to load images that are stored in the repository, hence why this solution is used instead
* [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) - Needed in order to install packages/tools into workspace
* [Passlib](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Package installed in order to hash passwords that are stored into the database
* [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) - for providing a colour palette based off one colour that was intended to be used
* [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/) - efficient solution to generate a SECRET key for securing hashed password stored in the database
* [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) - Used to create data schema diagram

### Languages
This project predominantly uses HTML, CSS and Python programming languages. While it would be considered a strong addition to include Javascript for this project to improve user experience, there are three reasons why, within the time scope for this project with Code Institute, that it does not include any. These include:
 - Majority of focus was placed on creating features that require python, Flask and Jinja, and as a result, has given limited-to-no time for implementing Javascript into the front end
- Considering the user stories for this website/application, the aim is to have simplicity, and the website provides this. Also, since the target audience and engagement aims to be fun/casual, it isn’t the highest priority that the user interface is of the highest quality in order to induce a positive experience for users. The developer believes that the functionality itself can provide the /funcomedy experience users are looking for
- the inclusion of Javascript code is not a requirement for this project in terms of the time scope for Code Institute. While it would be beneficial to include Javascript, the developer has chosen to submit it in a state where it would be easy to implement this kind of code in future development
- According to the [Progressive Enhancement Methodology](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/) for web design, it is crucial to ensure that one has built a well functioning website in stages, as well as ‘release early, release often’. In accordance to this methodology, I have looked to tackle the first two layers in securing the HTML and CSS setup is functioning well enough so that, if Javascript would be disabled/fail, the fallback version would still fulfill user needs well. This [article][] also describes what websites could still function well without Javascript, potentially hinting that this methodology is done by the top players in social media/ecommerce industries. 

## Testing
All information about the testing procedures I conducted can be found here in a separate [testing.md file][]

## Credits

### Idea Inspiration
The developer found an article that gave inspiration to pursue a project that would involve creating a Mad Libs generator. Idea 6 of ‘Basic Project Ideas’ in this [article](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-project-ideas/) inspired the idea

### Content

I used a number of Mad Libs templates to help hard code templates in my database:
- [Political Speech template](https://www.pinterest.se/pin/341710690461791039/)
- [Wedding Guest Book Entry](https://www.pinterest.se/pin/581527370611975121/)
- [Newspaper Article](https://www.pinterest.se/pin/292663675778566922/)
- [My Trip To Disney World within this PDF link](https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~vijaya/ssrvm/worksheetscd/getWorksheets.com/Language%20Arts/madlibsdoc.pdf)
- [Love Poem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=94&v=u7g9mRzQLYE&feature=emb_logo). On top of the suggestion for a short template to use, this gave inspiration for how to use Python to code a Mad Libs game, which I could build upon by seeing how I could do this to meet the project requirements.

Information about what Mad Libs is I got from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs), a definition I used in the information section of the landing page for non-logged in users/visitors

Inspiration for writing my README.md and testing.md files came from this repository by [AJGreaves on Github](https://github.com/AJGreaves/familyhub), especially in terms of content related to Deployment. I made sure to check the latest documentation concerning how to run the project locally and how to deploy to Heroku in order to ensure I adjusted information to be accurate at the time of writing this README. I would also make sure to give relevant information to how to run this project specifically locally.

### Media
The following images were used to give life to the website, attempting to have images that would help define the theme of the website:

### Code
- [‘One Page Wonder’ Start Bootstrap theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/one-page-wonder/) utilized for designing landing page as well as inspiration for general styles for button components, the navbar and containers for images to be circular
- [‘Start Bootstrap Code Snippet of Login Screen](https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/lo) used for styling pages with forms
- [Footer from a previous project by the developer](https://github.com/Ljungwaldh/First-Milestone-Project/blob/master/index.html#L332) which was subsequently modified in terms of content to suit the needs of the website
- [Login and user session system inspired by repository by kevin-ci on Github](https://github.com/kevin-ci/flask-mongo-logins/blob/master/app.py), including function decorator that is applied on relevant routes to check if there is a user who has logged in accessing that route. This also includes how to hash passwords using [Passlib] to ensure stored passwords are encrypted
- [Comprehensive example .gitignore file](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore) used to increase security of my Github repository, suggested by the developer’s mentor Anthony Ngene
- Method and code for generating Mad lib records provided via tutoring from Kevin Loughrey at Code Institute, helping to build [zip method code](https://github.com/Ljungwaldh/Milestone-Project-3/blob/master/app.py) in the project
- [Guard clauses used in register and login routes](https://github.com/Ljungwaldh/Milestone-Project-3/blob/master/app.py) in python code implemented as a result from tutoring from Yoni Lavi at Code Institute
- [W3Schools code](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_parallax_percent) providing understanding on how best to build a full page background image
[W3Schools code on maxlength input attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_input_attributes_maxlength) used to give further security to input fields in the website
