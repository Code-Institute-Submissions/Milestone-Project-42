# Totally Mad-Libz

This website will serve the purpose of providing a platform and game for creating Mad Libs stories - these being stories generated by users providing a number of words as inputs, which will
then be rendered into a story template with the inputs placed in random places in the story. This should aim to induce feelings of fun and humour for users. Mad lib stories generated will be saved
in the library, where it can be compared with others in terms of upvoting entries that users find most entertaining. Users would also have the option to edit and delete the entries they created should they desire to.
By having such an application available, it could provide fun for dinner parties and social gatherings, both physical and virtual. Inspiration for this idea
has mainly come from the recent need for people needing new ways to entertain themselves indoors during the covid-19 situation. 

### Developer's goals:
* To display his skills in creating a game-like application for his portfolio that is feasible to create within a limited amount of time
* To spread joy to any degree within society during a difficult time for everyone
* To build an exciting application for the developer's portfolio, this being an idea he'll want to develop further in the future

### Goals of users:
* To have a new game and application that can entertain and humour them
* To have an easy-to-use tool for users to include another fun activity for party/social gathering situations, both physical and virtual

## UX

### Ideal User

#### Users visiting my website would be:
* From anyone in the world
* English speaking
* Enjoy social games

#### Users on my website will want to:
* Get inspiration for an activity to include at a social event/party
* Run the game effectively in a fun way
* Have an easy-to-understand user experience

#### Why this website is a great solution:
* Currently the majority of online mad lib generators can be confusing and/or have an outdated design for the modern era of web design, a factor in itself that can disenchant people seeking this kind of application.
* As mentioned above, at the tme of developing this project, we are dealing with the difficult situation of covid-19, requiring/strongly recommending people to stay indoors. With this has come the struggle for people to socially interact and have fun in new ways - predominately virtually
* This solution can provide an entertaining activity for individuals and/or groups, especailly in these times where adding this to virtual social interactions can provde extra entertainment and humour to share with others
